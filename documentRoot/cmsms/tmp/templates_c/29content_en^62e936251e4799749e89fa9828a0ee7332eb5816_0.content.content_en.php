?><p>A client for the ModuleRepository, this module allows you to see what modules are available, the version number, size, and Status/Action (whether it is already installed or not), read the Help and About for each module, letting you install modules from remote sites without the need for FTP'ing, or unzipping archives. Module XML files are downloaded using SOAP, integrity verified, and then expanded automatically.</p><p>ModuleManager now checks dependencies. When dependencies are set, the module wont install until dependencies are met. Also a new tab is available, that shows newer versions of installed modules.</p><p>In short, this means that you can download and install modules directly from the Admin Panel. Any module that has been released as an XML file can be downloaded and installed. Go to Extensions &raquo; Module Manager in the Admin Panel to see the list of modules from the official CMSMS repository in the CMSMS Development Forge.</p><?php }
